# PublicSender
If you are creating spyware you probably don't want to post data from the victim on your own IP cuz while reversing malware reverser will discover itInstead of this use public available service to post data like anonymous comments what I was using in my [example](https://github.com/Transyl/PublicSender/blob/main/code/PubSender.cs), but obviously you must encrypt this all have access to data, however only you know key to decrypt it
